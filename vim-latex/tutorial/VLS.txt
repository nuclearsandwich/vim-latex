LaTeX Suite

Vim is undoubtedly one of the best editors ever made. LaTeX is an
extremley powerful, intelligent typesetter. LaTeX Suite aims at bringing
together the best of both these worlds.

Yeah, right. but, why Vim? what's so great about it? why not emacs? OK
let's do a quick comparison of the two editors:

(G)Vim: Vi is a text editor designed to use the "typewriter" keys
only. It doesn't need the function keypad, the cursor keypad or the
numeric keypad. works in 3 modes -visual, edit and command modes. some
commands may also be run in visual mode. Vi has many features of ex and
sed and a very small footprint compared to emacs. It is installed on all
*nix systems. Vi keybindings are also used extensively in other tools like
"man" pages and "less". It's an excellent tool for touch-typists. Vim
is like a souped up Vi and is available on Macs and windows machines as
well. Gvim is Vim with a GUI front end and has a menu bar, a tool bar
-just like other GUI applications.

emacs: A text editor (and a whole lot more -almost an operating
system) designed to use the "full" keyboard. Doesn't have "modes" as in
Vi. Very, very large footprint. Not necessarily available on all *nix
computers. Preferred tool by programmers. emacs keybindings are used as
default in bash, although vi keybindings are available as an option.

LaTeX Suite attempts to provide a comprehensive set of tools to view, edit
and compile LaTeX documents without needing to ever quit Vim. Together,
they provide tools starting from macros to speed up editing LaTeX
documents to compiling LaTeX files to forward searching .dvi documents.

See the features page for a brief tour of the various features of
LaTeX Suite. All these features can be tuned extensively. LaTeX Suite
is made for Vim versions 6.0 and above.

{Vi of course does not have any of this}

Some assumptions this tutorial makes:

1) you already have Vim and Gvim installed on your computer and they
   are working correctly.

2) You already know something about and are comfortable with using Vim
   and Gvim.

This tutorial is meant to be used along with hands On training. Merely
reading this tutorial won't do you any good. So if you haven't already
got (G)Vim and LaTeX Suite, download and install them now.

Note: Since I'm a Debian user, this tutorial is naturally most suited
to GNU/Linux or *nix users. I shall, of course attempt to provide any
tips i can for Windows users, but please keep in mind that I'm not very
well versed with Windows. beware, you've been warned.

Download LaTeX Suite:

You can download the appropriate LaTeX Suite archive for *nix, GNU/Linux
or Winxx, from this site; Homepage: http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net


Installation Instructions

Extract the .zip archive, which you downloaded, into your ~/vimfiles
directory (for Windows Users) or the tar.gz archive into $HOME/.vim
directory (if you are using *nix or GNU/Linux). Make sure you have the
following settings in your .vimrc

    " Necessary: This setting tells (G)Vim to load LaTeX Suite
    " when a .tex, .ltx or .latex file is opened.
    
    filetype plugin indent on
    
    " IMPORTANT: win32 users will need to have 'shellslash'
    " set so that latex can be called correctly.

    set shellslash

Next time you start vim and edit a latex file, LaTeX Suite should
automatically be activated.

NOTE: If you already have a system with filetype specific files (ftplugin,
indent etc) set up for the '.tex, .ltx or .latex' filetypes, then you
might want to rename them to avoid potential conflicts -see the advanced
installation instructions for potential conflicts.

Advanced Installation Instructions :

The archive above will unzip in the following manner:

latexSuite.zip
    |
    |   ltags
    |
    +---plugin
    |       imaps.vim
    |       SyntaxFolds.vim
    |       libList.vim
    |
    +---ftplugin
    |   |   tex_latexSuite.vim
    |   |
    |   \---latex-suite
    |       ... latex suite files ...
    |          includes templates,
    |             macros etc
    +---doc
    |       latex-suite.txt
    |       latexhelp.txt
    |                                __
    +---indent                         |
    |       tex.vim                    |
    |                                  | <in red colour>
    \---compiler                       |
            tex.vim                  __|


The files shown in red will potentially over-write files already in
your system. In this case, you will want to unpack the archive into
a temporary folder and then copy over the files which you need. Note
however, that this is not supported. You will have to take care of the
bugs which you encounter due to this, yourself.


Setting up Help in (G)Vim for LaTeX Suite:

After having installed LaTeX Suite, let us integrate the included
latex-suite.txt and latexhelp.txt files into Vim's help system, start
(G)Vim and do the following from within (G)Vim to setup the help files
for LaTeX Suite.

:helptags ~/.vim/doc       (for *nix users)
:helptags ~/vimfiles/doc   (for windows users)

After that, you can do

:help latex-suite

to browse the LaTeX Suite online manuals from within (G)Vim itself.

as a bonus, you can also do

:help latex

to browse the LaTeX manuals that are provided by LaTeX Suite.

Coding our first LaTeX source file with the help of LaTeX Suite:

Now that we have installed LaTeX Suite on our PC, let's start with
typesetting our first LaTeX document using LaTeX Suite. 

Since we are doing this for the first time, let's use Gvim rather than
Vim. With Gvim, we have the advantage of using menus. LaTeX Suite builds
a comprehensive set of menus that will help us learn LaTeX as well as
to help us learn to use LaTeX Suite features. As you get used to the
keymaps and various features of LaTeX Suite, you can go back to using Vim.

Initially, let's start gvim from a term window with the command;

$ gvim myfile.tex <return>

This should start Gvim and you will notice that as it starts, Gvim will
four new menu-items in the menu bar:

1) TeX-Suite
2) TeX-Environments
3) TeX-Elements
4) TeX-Math

The text area should be blank, unless you had a file called "myfile.tex",
containing some text.

You will notice that all the menu-items added by LaTeX Suite start with
the tag "TeX-". Explore these menu-items.  We will use some of these
features later as we learn to use LaTeX Suite -at the moment we are
merely exploring.

1) TeX-Suite: You will notice that the menu-item "TeX-Suite" offers
a host of features which would be applicable to most LaTeX files
in general. Among other things, you will notice something called
templates. We will be using them very soon. It also contains an item
to compile you latex source, view the latex source or search the source
for something.

2) TeX-Environments: In this menu-item we discover that a LaTeX file
can have multiple environments like chapters, sections subsections,
tables, etc. You will learn about these things as you learn to typeset
your documents in LaTeX. We will of course see how we can exploit these
features of LaTeX Suite.

3) TeX-Elements: Things like paper dimensions, font sizes and types,
counters to keep a count of the figures and tables that you use. Counters
to keep a tag of the page numbers, etc. are available here.

4) TeX-Math: This is where LaTeX really exells and this is the menu-item
which helps speed up the typesetting of your math documents. You'll see
Greek alphabets, arrows, binary operators, logical operators, a large
collection of math symbols, log, trigonometry... it's a long list and
I think you've got the idea by now as to what I'm talking about so I'll
skip the detailed list of math related items.

Your first LaTeX file:

Let's start with the first LaTeX Exercise in the book.

Click on TeX-Suite>Templates>article

The following will appear in the text area on your screen:

Notice the lines;

\begin{document}

\end{document}

That <++> is a place holder for the text you will type in later as part
of the exercise. Now, read the last line. it says "Hit ENTER", go ahead
and do that. Now you see a slight change in the onscreen contents;

The <++> symbols have disappeared and your cursor is now positioned in
their place, blinking away to glory. that's your queue to type in the text
content of your article. As you enter the text, you'll notice something;

you're typing in the line;

This is my \emph{first} document prepared in \LaTeX.

If you started typing that in as;

This is my \emph{}

With the intention of backspacing over the closing "}", you'll notice
that LaTeX Suite has suddenly tried to guess your needs and inserted
some more place holders for you. That line now looks like this;

This is my \emph{<++>}

...sure, go ahead and overwrite that <++> with the word "first". Finish
typing that line and Hit the ESC key. Now, we're done with the first
part of building your first LaTeX document with LaTeX Suite. Let's
go to the next part compiling your first LaTeX Document.

To compile "myfile.tex" click on TeX-Suite>Compile ...or, hit the keys
\ll

This is a small document and will compile in no time. Let's see what we
got, click on TeX-Suite>View or hit the keys \lv -this should immediately
open you newly compiled document using xdvi. Time to sit back and admire
your handiwork. Now, your first exercise is complete -and it was entirely
your handiwork, Congratulations.

Let's go a little further. kill that Xdvi window and go back to editing
myfile.tex in that Gvim window. Append some words to that so it looks
like this;

This is my \emph{first} document prepared in \LaTeX on \today.

Recompile this file and view the results -you know how to do this now,
right?

OK, so we prepared and compiled our first LaTeX Document. Now, let's take
stock of what happened here. We typed in exactly one line of content and
all of two LaTeX commands. But, the file contains 9 lines and some more
LaTeX commands that we did not type in manually. These were inserted
automatically by Latex Suite for us. This is just a small example
of what LaTeX Suite can do.

Now, let's modify this source file. We'll add another line of content
to it.

Below the line we wrote earlier, insert the following;

This is the first line. 

Now, while we're still in insert mode, click on;

TeX-Environments>EnvCommands>Tabbing>_\\

That line now looks like;

This is the first line. \\

Now, continue adding more text to that line so it looks like;

This is the first line. \\ This is the second line.

Now, save your file, compile it and view the results.

Tip: You can also select one of the available Templates using the keyboard
alone. The procedure is as follows;

Start Gvim with the command

$ gvim myfile2.tex

Now, give command :TTemplate<enter> (Please note: LaTeX Suite is case
sensitive)

This will present you with a list of all available templates:

this appear to be familiar? -Yes, this is what you got when you used
the menu-item to select the template.

Congratulations are in order, by the way, You just used your first,
advanced LaTeX Suite command. You're already on your way towards becoming
a non-GUI, poweruser.

With that, we've learnt how to use the Templates. The other templates
can be used in the same way. Let's go on to the next section.


Open 'myfile.tex' with Gvim and from the menu select
TeX-Environments>Lists>Itemize now your screen should look like this;

-- XIM INSERT -- 
------------ on screen ------------ 

Now, from the menu, click TeX-Environments>Lists>itemize -four new lines
just appeared on your screen like this;

------------ on screen ------------ 
...
This is my first list of items.
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
\end{itemize}<++>
\end{document}
------------ on screen ------------ 

...and the cursor is located after the "\item". That's where you start
add content so it looks like this;

------------ on screen ------------ 
...
This is my first list of items.
\begin{itemize}
	\item rice
\end{itemize}<++>
\end{document}
------------ on screen ------------ 


Now, we'll move to the next line and add another item, click on
TeX-Environmants>EnvCommands>Lists>item -a "\item" command appears where
your cursor was, ad content to that and add another item and remove that
place-holder <++> (we won't be using it) so it looks like this;

------------ on screen ------------ 
...
This is my first list of items.
\begin{itemize}
	\item rice
	\item wheat
	\item corn
\end{itemize}
\end{document}
------------ on screen ------------ 

Done? ok. let's add another list of items, this time using the keyboard
only. Insert a blank line after the \end{itemize} in our list and do add
some content so it looks like;

------------ on screen ------------ 
...
This is my first list of items.
\begin{itemize}
	\item rice
	\item wheat
	\item corn
\end{itemize}

This is my second list of items.
apples
oranges
grapes
plankton

\end{document}
------------ on screen ------------ 

Now, hit the ESC key. Done? OK, now, move the cursor to the "a" of
apples and hit CTRL+V and using the cursor (or j) key move the cursor
down to plankton. Done? OK, now hit the End key (or $). Done? Good,
you've just marked a block of text in visual mode. Now hit the keys
",it". Now your screen looks like;

\end{itemize}

\end{document}
------------ on screen ------------ 

Position your cursor under the "a" of apples and hit ALT+n followed
immediately by "cli", this should insert the \item -you'll have to put
a space after that \item. Do this for oranges, grapes and plankton too,
so the whole thing now looks like this;

This is my second list of items.
\begin{itemize}
	\item apples
	\item oranges
	\item grapes
	\item plankton
\end{itemize}
...
...
------------ on screen ------------ 

Now save the file, compile and view the results.

Now let's try something more advanced. We need to use this this for
using packages.  Packages vastly improve capabilites of LaTeX -and
LaTeX-Suite has great system of supporting packages. An example, amsmath
(this extends math typesetting) in our document. Go to the \documentclass
line and press 'o'. It opens new line. Now go to the packages menu:
TeX-Suite>Packages>Supported and check if amsmath is supported. It
is. Choose. Now you have:

------------ on screen ------------ 
%        File: myfile.tex
%     Created: Wed May 21 08:00 PM 2003 I
% Last Change: Wed May 21 08:00 PM 2003 I
%
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[|]{amsmath}<++>
\begin{document}

\end{document}
------------ on screen ------------ 

<< cursor at | >>

Now you can add some options. Look again in TeX-Suite>Packages menu. At
the end are two new items: amsmath Options and amsmath Commands. Look
into Options and choose one: tbtags. It will be inserted with comma,
delete comma and press <C-J>. Press <CR>, you want to add new package.
Oops, it is not supported. But you won't have to write the whole command
(\usepackage{asdf}) just asdf<F5>, LaTeX-Suite completes the rest for
you.

Of course, you won't have to repeatedly need to use the menu to insert
declaration amsmath package.  After <F5> LaTeX-Suite will check if this
package is supported, if yes, it will automagically add the relevant
menus, highlighting for new environments, functions specific to that
package and so on and so forth.

Tips: (Something worth remembering and knowing)

The function key <F5> is a shortcut -In texrc you can move Packages menu
to menu bar.


By now, you must got comfortable with using the LaTeX Suite Menus and
you've understood that they help to either run some commands or to insert
some LaTeX tags or commands. From this point onwards you really don't
need much help with using the menu. You can learn to use the rest of
the menu without my help -trust me.

While doing the above exercises, you must have noticed that many of the
LaTeX Suite menu items have some "jumble" of alphabets along side of them,
like for example;

figure      EFI(,fi)
bfseries    FBF(`bf)

The three capital letters are the insert mode mappings and the chracters
enclosed in the braces are the visual mode mappings. In the next section
we'll learn to use such keyboard's hotkeys that have been built into
LaTeX Suite.

LATEX MACROS

Latex-Suite ships with a very comprehensive set of insert mode and visual mode
mappings and menu items to typeset most of the LaTeX elements.

The term "macro" refers to a collection of 3 objects, an insert mode
keymap, a visual mode keymap and a menu item. For example, a figure
macro refers to the insert mode mapping 'EFI', the visual mode mapping
',fi' and the menu item Tex-Environments.

For environments, sections and fonts, the insert mode mappings are a sequence
of 3 capital letters. The visual mode mapping follows from the insert mode
mapping by replacing the first character by a comma (',') (for environments
and sections) or back-tick ('`') (for fonts) and converting the rest to lower
case. 

 -------------------------------------------
              | Insert Mode   |  Visual Mode
 -------------+---------------+-------------
 environmnts  |    EFI        |    ,fi
 fonts        |    FSF        |    `sf
 section      |    SSE        |    ,se 
 -------------------------------------------

Most of the the menu items also specify the insert and visual mode
macros. The menus behave differently from the insert mode macros in that
they ask questions on the command line in a "wizard" sort of manner
and then generate a template which includes the information gathered.
By contrast, the insert mode macros do not ask any questions and generate
a template with place-holders at each input location.

NOTE: All these macros handle place-holders in a specific manner. The
first place-holder is selected for replacement and then the next as
you jump from one to the next in serial order. Placeholders mark off
locations where the relevant editing has to be done. As an example,
when the user types in "EFI" in insert mode, you will get the following:

      \begin{figure}[<+htpb+>]
         \begin{center}
            \psfig{figure=<+eps file+>}
         \end{center}
         \caption{<+caption text+>}
         \label{fig:<+label+>}
      \end{figure}<++>

The place-holder <+htpb+> will be selected and you will be left in
select-mode so that you can continue typing straight away. After
having typed in the file name, you can press Control-J (while still in
insert-mode). This will take you directly to the next "place-holder". i.e,
the <+eps file+> will be visually selected with vim in select mode again
for typing in the caption. This saves on a lot of key presses.

NOTE: These mappings are are not standard mappings in the sense that
only the last character is mapped. For example, in the example above,
you can press the characters 'E', 'F' and 'I' as slowly as you wish. The
characters are visible as you type them and you can use the movement or
backspace key to correct yourself unlike "normal" mappings.

The macros can be divided into the following main categories:
1) Environment Mappings
2) Font Mappings
3) Section Mappings
4) AucTeX key bindings
5) Diacritics
6) Greek Letters
7) Math Menu

Environment mappings:
These mappings insert LaTeX "environments" such as
      \begin{center}
          <++>
      \end{center}<++>
with the cursor left at the first place-holder.
(The environment above is generated by typing ECE in insert mode)

Rule for remembering shortcuts:
-------------------------------
a) All environment mappings begin with 'E'

b) If the environment can be broken up into 2 distinct words, such as
   flushright (flush + right), then the next 2 letters are the first
   letters of the 2 words.

   Example: 
        flushleft  (_f_lush + _l_eft)  ---> EFL
        flushright (_f_lush + _r_ight) ---> EFR
        eqnarray   (_e_qn + _a_rray)   ---> EEA

   If on the other hand, the environment name cannot be broken up into
   2 distinct words, then the next 2 letters are the first 2 letters of
   the name of the environment.

   Example:
        equation (_eq_uation)          ---> EEQ

Note:
1) Of course, not every last one of the environments can follow
this rule because of ambiguities. In case of doubt, pull down the
Tex-Environments menu. The menu item should give the hint for the map.

2) The above rule of three letter mappings is used throughout LaTeX Suite.

Along with the insert mode mappings, a set of visual mode mappings is
provided which encloses the visually selected region in an environment.
These maps are related to the corresponding insert mode mappings by the
following rule:

    ECE           --> ,ce

...and so on. i.e, the leading E becomes ',' and the next 2 letters are
small case. Some of the visual mode mappings are sensetive to whether
you choose line-wise or character wise. For example, if you choose a
word and press ",ce", then you get \centerline{word}, but if you press
",ce" on a line-wise selection, you get:

      \begin{center}
          line
      \end{center}

for a complete list of these keybindings refer to the Cheat Sheet that
comes with this book.

Font Mappings:

These mappings insert font descriptions such as:
      \textsf{}<++>
again with the cursor at the first place-holder (between the curly
braces).

Mnemonic:

1. The first letter is always F (F for font)
2. The next 2 letters are the 2 letters describing the font.

Example: the above mapping is triggered by FSF.

Just like environment mappings, you can visually select an area and press
`sf to have it enclosed in: 
      \textsf{word}
or 
      {\sffamily
      line
      }
depending on character-wise or line-wise selection.

for a complete list of these keybindings refer to the Cheat Sheet that
comes with this book.

Section Mappings:

These insert LaTeX sections "\section" etc. Just as in the case of
environments and fonts, can be enclosed with a visual selection. The
enclosing is not sensetive to character or line-wise selection.

Mnemonic: (make your own :-) 
      SPA for part
      SCH for chapter
      SSE for section
      SSS for subsection
      SS2 for subsubsection
      SPG for paragraph
      SSP for subparagraph

Example:
    SSE in insert mode inserts
        \section{}<++>
   If you select a word or line and press `se, then you get
        \section{section name}
   example: you type in the word
        apple select it in visual mode and hit "`se", you get
        \section{apple}

   The menu item in Tex-Environments>Sections have a sub-menu called
    'Advanced'. Choosing an item from this sub-menu asks a couple of
    questions (whether you want to include the section in the table of
    contents, whether there is a shorter name for the table of contents)
    and then creates a more intelligent template.

   Try this; click on TeX-Environment>section>Advanced>Part LaTeX Suite
   will ask you a question on the status line of gvim like this; "Title?"
   type in "Some Title" and hit enter. Now it asks "Short Title?" and you
   respond by typing in "sometitle" and hit enter. Now, you're asked the
   question "Include in table of contents [y]/n ?" -go ahead, type "y"
   (that's the default anyway) and hit enter. This is the output of all
   the questions you answered:

   \part[sometitle]{Some Title}

   Your cursor will be placed at the end of the above line and vim will
   be in insert mode so you can start typing in more material right away.

AucTeX key bindings:

These are simple 2 key expansions for some very commonly used LaTeX
elements. As you read further down this chapter, you will notice that the
AucTeX keybindings, Greek Letter keybindings and the Math keybindings
are the 2 sets that follow this simple 2 key expansion system. The
rest of LaTeX Suite keymaps are all on the 3 letter pattern discussed
earlier. These are all used in insert mode.

Examples:
    `.   expands to   \cdot 
    `*   expands to   \times
    `~   expands to   \tilde{<++>}<++>

As you noticed, those placeholders are present here as well.

For a complete list of these keybindings refer to the Cheat Sheet that
comes with this book.

Diacritics: 
Diacritics speed up typing European languages.

    +<l>  expands to    \v{<l>}
    =<l>  expands to    \'{<l>}
   where <l> is a letter ('a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z')

    +}    expands to    \"{a}
    +:    expands to    \^{o}

Note:
1) Latex Suite also ships with a function SmartBS(), which offers
another convinience, i.e diacritic characters are treated as a single
character for backspacing.

2) This is disabled by default.

Greek Letters:

These are, like the AucTeX keybindings, available through simple 2 key
expansions for the Greek Letters supported by LaTeX.

Examples:

   `a    expands to   \alpha
   `A    expands to   \Alpha  
   `b    expands to   \beta
   `B    expands to   \Beta  

Note: LaTeX does not support all Upper case Greek Letters.

for a complete list of these keybindings refer to the Cheat Sheet that
comes with this book.

Math Menu:

This menu contains over 600 commands for inserting math signs into LaTeX
document. They are grouped into submenus as: Arrows, MathFonts, Greek
(letters), BinaryRel(ations) and many others. At the top are basic signs
leading into math mode. Some of symbols have hints for mappings in AucTeX
style. You will find many of these listed in the cheat sheets attached
to this book.

LaTeX Dictionary

Latex-suite ships with a dictionary of over 600 commands from LaTeX
and popular packages. When latex-suite starts up, it automatically
adds this dictionary to vim's 'dictionary' option for use with vim's
"i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K" command. Let's use this once.

Open your myfile.tex with gvim and go to the line that says
\end{itemize}. Palce tge cursor somewhere under the word "itemize",
say under the "m". Now hit "dw", this will delete the rest of the word
after the "m" and it now looks like this;

   \end{item}

Now, what we have is a part of the word enumerate and let's pretend that
we've forgotten the exact spelling of that command or we've forgotten
exactly what we're looking for but, we're sure that if we see the word
again, we'll remember...

so, let's try and get the LaTeX Suite Dictionary to jog our memory -and
to complete the required command for us.

Move the cursor immediately under the } immediately after the "item"
and go into insert mode by hitting the "i" key. Now, hit the key sequence
"CTRL+x" followed by "CTRL+k" repeatedly till we see the word "itemize"
appear in place of "item". Voila, LaTeX Suite searched for and completed
the "enumerate" command for you. Now we can move the cursor to some
other location and continue working right away.

In the above exercise, we had to hit "CTRL+k" thrice for completing
"itemize". When we hit "CTRL+k" repeatedly, we actually cycled through
a list of words before you got the exact word that you were searching for.

LaTeX Folding

Latex-suite ships with the plugin SyntaxFolds.vim which is a plugin for
creating "fake" syntax folds on the fly. The fold method is actually manual
but the folding is based on LaTeX syntax. This offers a speed increase over
regular syntax folding. Ofcourse it has the disadvantage that the folds are
not dynamic, i.e newly created syntax items are not automatically folded up.
(This is a compromise between speed and convinience).

When you open up a LaTeX file, all the portions will be automatically folded
up. However, no new folds will be created until you press <F6> or \rf. (rf
stands for "refresh folds").

The fold-text is set to the first line of the folded text unless the fold is a
table, figure etc. (an environment). In this case, if a \caption and/or a
label is found in the folded region, then those are used to make a more
meaningful fold-tex, otherwise the second line of the environment is displayed
along with the name of the environment. In other words, the following 

    \begin{figure}[h]
      \centerline{\psfig{figure=slidercrank.eps,height=6cm}}
      \caption{The Slider Crank Mechanism.}
      \label{fig:slidercrank}
    \end{figure}
    % a LaTeX comment.
    \begin{eqnarray}
      \sin(\pi) = 0
    \end{eqnarray}

will be shown as: 

  +---  5 lines: figure (fig:slidercrank) : The Slider Crank Mechanism. -----
  % a LaTeX comment.
  +---  3 lines: eqnarray () : \sin(\pi) = 0 --------------------------------


LaTeX Smart Keys

Latex suite ships with the following smart keys:

Smart Backspace
    Pressing <BS> in insert mode checks to see whether we are just after
    something like \'{a} and if so, deletes all of it. i.e, diacritics are
    treated as single characters for backspacing.

Smart Quotes
    Pressing " (english double quote) will insert `` or '' by making an
    intelligent guess about whether we intended to open or close a quote.

Smart Space
    Latex-suite maps the <space> key in such a way that $ characters are not
    broken across lines. It does this by first setting tw=0 so that Vim will
    not automatically break lines and then maps the <space> key to insert
    newlines keeping $$'s on the same line.

Smart Dots
    Pressing ... (3 dots) results in \ldots outside math mode and \cdots in
    math mode.

Usinging LaTeX Packages

Now let's do something more advanced, We'll need this for using
LaTeX packages.  Packages vastly improve functionalities of LaTeX -and
LaTeX-Suite has a great system of supporting packages.

Example: amsmath, this extends math editing in our document.

Open myfile.tex with gvim. Go to the \documentclass line and press 'o'. It
opens new line. Now go to the packages menu: TeX-Suite>Packages>Supported
and check if amsmath is supported. It is. click on amsmath. Now you have:

%        File: myfile.tex
%     Created: Sun May 25 07:00 PM 2003 I
% Last Change: Sun May 25 07:00 PM 2003 I
%
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[|]{amsmath}<++>
\begin{document}

\end{document}

<< cursor at | >>

Now you can add some options. Look again in TeX-Suite>Packages menu. At
the end of the list, two new items have appeared;

"amsmath Options"    and
"amsmath Commands"

Look in the "Options" tree and choose one: "tbtags". That will be inserted
with a comma, delete the comma and press <C-J> followed by <CR>.

You want to add new package, say "helvetic".  Oops, "helvetic"
is not supported. No problem, you don't have write whole command

\usepackage{helvetic}

...just type in the word 

helvetic

and hit <F5>, LaTeX-Suite completes the rest for you. Of course you
don't always need to use the menu to insert declaration amsmath package.
After <F5> LaTeX-Suite will check if this package is supported, and
if it is, it will do all the magic -add menus, highlighting for new
environments, functions specific for package and so on...

Things to remember/know:
<F5> shortcut

Tip: In texrc you can move Packages menu directly onto the menu bar.

LaTeX Suite Commands

LatexSuite defines set of commands for non-GUI and power users. They are
taking care about Macros, Templates and Packages.

:TMacro [{macro}]
                When used without any arguments, this lists all available
                custom macros defined in ftplugin/latex-suite/macros/
                directory and prompts you to choose one of them.

                With one argument |:read| this macro under cursor
                position.  With more than one argument it will not work.

:TMacroEdit [{macro}]
                Splits window for editing {macro}.  When used without
                any arguments lists all available custom macros defined
                in ftplugin/latex-suite/macros/ directory and prompt
                you to choose one of them.

:TMacroNew
                Splits window to write a new custom
                macro. Directory in new buffer is locally changed to
                ftplugin/latex-suite/macros/.

:TMacroDelete [{macro}]
                Deletes {macro} from ftplugin/latex-suite/macros/
                directory.  When used without any arguments lists all
                available macros defined in latex-suite/macros/ directory
                and prompt you to choose one of them.

:TPackage [{package} [{package} ...]]
                When used without any arguments lists name of the packages
                for which support is available. Report depends if you
                are using GUI version and/or g:Tex_Menus is set to 1 or
                not. When you are not using menus command lists files
                from ftplugin/latex-suite/dictionaries/ (this is main
                support for non-menus version of latexSuite) if menus
                are on |TPackage| lists files from latex-suite/packages/
                directory.

                When {package} is given command turns on all possible support
                for this {package} (|latex-menu-packages|,
                |latex-packages-dictionary|). Number of arguments separated
                with spaces is limited only with common sense.

:TPackageUpdate
                This command `reads' the name of package under the cursor
                and turns on any possible support.

:TPackageUpdateAll
                After issuing this command LaTeX Suite scans the file in
                looking for not declared packages, removing not needed entries
                from Packages menu and turning off not necessary packages'
                dictionaries.

:TTemplate [{template}]
                When used without any arguments lists all available templates
                from latex-suite/templates/ directory and prompts to choose
                one of them.
                With one argument :0|read| {template} file.
                With more than one argument it will not work :)

:TSection [{argument}]
                Used without any arguments inserts last section type
                (|latex-sectioning|).
                Accepts arguments:
                <n>     inserts section name in <n> logical level.
                        Levels are:
                        0 part
                        1 chapter
                        2 section
                        3 subsection
                        4 subsubsection
                        5 paragraph
                        6 subparagraph

                +<n>    inserts section name <n> logical levels above the last
                        used comand

                -<n>    inserts section name <n> logical levels below the last
                        used comand

                +       inserts section name one logical level below the last
                        used command (equal to +1).

                ++      inserts section name two logical levels below the last
                        used command (equal to +2).

                -       inserts section name one logical level over the last
                        used command (equal to -1).

                --      inserts section name two logical levels over the last
                        used command (equal to -2).

                Command accepts also latexSuite mappings (|latex-macros|)
                without preceding S and in lowercase: 
                        :TSection pa
                will result in \part{}. It is possible to use full names of
                sections:
                        :TSection part

:TSectionAdvanced
                Accepts the same arguments as |TSection| but leads to a couple
                of questions (whether you want to include the section in the
                table of contents, whether there is a shorter name for the
                table of contents) and then creates a more intelligent
                template.

:TLook
                Accepts one argument. Will look through .tex files in
                directory of edited file for argument. It can be regexp. You
                don't have to enclose argument in "". <cr> takes you to
                location. Other keys work as described in |latex-viewer|.
                Note: TLook uses :grep command and is using 'grepprg'. Its
                regular expressions can be different from those of Vim.

:TLookBib
                Accepts one argument. Will look through .bib files in
                directory of edited file for argument. It can be regexp. You
                don't have to enclose argument in "". <cr> takes you to
                location. Other keys work as described in |latex-viewer|.
                Note: TLookBib uses :grep command and is using 'grepprg'.  Its
                regular expressions can be different from those of Vim.

:TLookAll
                Accepts one argument. Will look through all files in directory
                of edited file for argument. It can be regexp. You don't have
                to enclose argument in "". <cr> takes you to location. Other
                keys work as described in |latex-viewer|.
                Note: TLookuses :grep command and is using 'grepprg'.  Its
                regular expressions can be different from those of Vim.

:TPartComp
                No argument allowed but accepts range in all formats. Define
                fragment of interest with :'a,'b, :/a/,/b/, :'<,'> or :20,30.
                All other rules of compilation apply.

:TPartView
                Show last compiled fragment. All rules of viewing apply but
                |latex-searching|.

Features

LaTeX Suite provides a comprehensive set of tools so you can do all
your LaTeX typesetting and programming from within (G)Vim. Here's a brief
tour of the various features:

Editing: LaTeX Suite ships with a very comprehensive set of insert
mode and visual mode mappings and menu items to typeset most of the LaTeX
elements. These range from 3 letter insert mode mappings which insert a
skeleton of common typesetting elements to visual mode mappings which
enclose the selected region in braces, parentheses, etc. The mappings
can also be accessed via the menus in Gvim.

Compiling: You can compile your .tex, .ltx or .latex file from within
(G)Vim. The list of errors is shown in a quick fix window so you can directly
go to the location of an error. The compiler plugin can be dynamically
reconfigured to show you more or less warnings.

Viewing: By pressing a key from within (G)Vim, the .dvi viewer is started
up. You can also do forward and inverse searching on your .dvi file from
within (G)vim.

Folding: LaTeX Suite ships with the plugin SyntaxFolds.vim which is a
plugin for creating "fake" syntax folds on the fly. The fold method is
actually manual but, the folding is based on LaTeX syntax. This offers
a speed increase over regular syntax folding. When you open up a LaTeX
file, all the portions will be automatically folded up.

Packages: This module provides ways of customizing the menus based
on which packages are being used in the current LaTeX file. When
latex-suite first starts up, it scans the LaTeX Suite master-file
for \usepackage{name} lines and if the corresponding package is found
in the ~/vim/ftplugin/latex-suite/packages/ directory, then creates a
sub-menu based on the specification found in that file. See the list of
currently supported packages.

LaTeX help file: LaTeX Suite ships with the standard TeXinfo file
translated into Vim help format so that you can get help for common
LaTeX commands from within (G)Vim.

Dictionary: LaTeX Suite ships with a dictionary with over 600 LaTeX
commands, which speeds up typing using the CTRL-X_d command of (G)Vim.

Customized Templates: LaTeX Suite ships with some commonly used LaTeX
templates. It is trivial to add your own templates. The templates can
contain dynamic data such as time of creation etc. See list of current
templates.

Customized Macros: LaTeX Suite makes it easy to add custom macros,
again with the possibility of dynamic content and automatic cursor
placement.
