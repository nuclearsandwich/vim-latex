    Latex-Suite attempts to provide a comprehensive set of tools to
    view, edit and compile LaTeX documents in Vim. Together, they
    provide tools starting from macros to speed up editing LaTeX
    documents to functions for forward searching .dvi documents.
    Latex-suite has been possible because of the contributions of many
    people. Please see |latex-suite-credits| for a list of people who
    have helped.

    Latex-suite is released under the Vim charityware license. For
    license and conditions of use look at |copyright|. Replace all
    occurences of ``Vim'' with ``Latex-Suite''. The current copyright
    holders of Latex-Suite are Srinath Avadhanula and Mikolaj Machowski.

   Latex-Suite works best if you have the following settings in your ~/.vimrc:
  </para>
  <programlisting>" this line is responsible for loading latex-suite when a .tex file is
" opened.
filetype plugin on
" for automatic indentation specific to LaTeX.
filetype indent on</programlisting>
  <para>
   In addition, the following settings could go in your ~/.vim/ftplugin/tex.vim
   file:
  </para>
  <programlisting>" this is mostly a matter of taste. but LaTeX looks good with just a bit
" of indentation.
set sw=2
" TIP: if you write your \label's as \label{fig:something}, then if you
" type in \ref{fig: and press &lt;C-n&gt; you will automatically cycle through
" all the figure labels. Very useful!

 <section id="latex-suite-templates">
  <title>Inserting Templates</title>
  <para>
   This functionality is available via the <literal>TeX-Suite &gt;
    Templates</literal> menu.
   This module provides a way to insert custom templates at the beginning of the
   current file.
  </para>
  <para>
   When latex-suite first starts up, it scans the
   <literal>$VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/templates/</literal>
   directory and creates menu items based on the files found there. When
   you select a template from this menu, the file will be read in above
   the first line of the current file.
  </para>
  <para>
   A template file can utlilize placeholders for initializing the cursor
   position when the template is read in and subsequent movement. In
   addition, template files can contain dynamic elements such as the
   time of creation of a file etc, by using vim expressions.
  </para>
  <para>
   You can place your own templates in the
   <literal>$VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/templates/</literal> directory in
   order for them to be available via the menu. Unless &ls; releases a
   template with the same name, these files should not get over-written
   when you install a new release over an existing one.
  </para>
  <note>
   <para>
    Templates are also accessible for non-gui users with the command
    |<literal>:TTemplate</literal>|. The argument should be name of
    the corresponding template file.  If the command is called
    without arguments (preferred usage), then a list of available
    templates is displayed and the user is asked to choose one of
    them.
   </para>
  </note>

 <section id="latex-macros">
  <title>&ls; Macros</title>
  <para>
   Latex-Suite ships with a very comprehensive set of insert mode and
   |visual-mode| mappings and menu items to typeset most of the LaTeX
   elements.
  </para>
  <note>
   <para>
    These mappings are are not standard mappings in the sense that
    only the last character is mapped. See plugin/imaps.vim for
    further documentation. For example, in the case of the mapping
    <literal>EFI</literal> provided by &ls; you can press the characters
    '<literal>E</literal>', '<literal>F</literal>' and '<literal>I</literal>'
    as slowly as you wish (unlike the normal <literal>imap</literal> command
    where <literal>timeout</literal> issues are involved). The characters are
    visible as you type them (unlike normal <literal>imap</literal>s) and you
    can use the movement or backspace key to correct yourself unlike normal
    mappings.
   </para>
  </note>
  <note id="place-holders">
   <title>Place Holders</title>
   <para>
    Almost all macros provided in &ls; implement Stephen Riem's bracketing
    system and Gergely Kontra's <literal>JumpFunc()</literal> for handling
    place-holders. This consists of using "place-holders" to mark off
    locations where the next relevant editing has to be done. As an example,
    when you type <literal>EFI</literal> in |insert-mode|, you will get the
    following:
   </para>
   <programlisting>\begin{figure}[h]
    \centerline{\psfig{figure=&lt;+eps file+&gt;}}
    \caption{&lt;+caption text+&gt;}
    \label{fig:&lt;+label+&gt;}
\end{figure}&lt;++&gt;</programlisting>
   <para>
    The text <literal>&lt;+eps file+&gt;</literal> will be selected and
    you will be left in |select-mode| so that you can continue typing
    straight away. After having typed in the file name, you can press
    <literal>&lt;Ctrl-J&gt;</literal> (while still in insert-mode). This will
    take you directly to the next "place-holder". i.e, <literal>&lt;+caption
     text+&gt;</literal> will be visually selected with Vim in select mode
    again for typing in the caption. This saves on a lot of key presses.
   </para>
  </note>
  <para>
   The following sections describe the various editing macros provided
   by &ls;.
  </para>
  <section id="insert-mode-environment-mappings">
   <title>Insert-mode Environment Mappings</title>
   <para> These mappings insert LaTeX "environments" such as:</para>
   <programlisting>\begin{center}
    &ph;
\end{center}&ph;</programlisting>
   <para>
    with the cursor left at the first |placeholder|. There are
    various ways of inserting environments into the source file. If
    the environment is a standard latex environment, then latex suite
    might also include common fields associated with it.
   </para>
   <section>
    <title>Method 1</title>
    <para>
     If you press <literal>&lt;F5&gt;</literal> in the
     insert mode while on an empty line, latex-suite prompts you
     with a list of environments you might want to insert. You can
     either choose one from the list or type in a new environment
     name. This list can be customized. See the 'Macros' section
     of the |texrc| file for details.
    </para>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>Method 2</title>
    <para>
     If you press <literal>&lt;F5&gt;</literal> while on a line
     containing a single word, then latex-suite creates a
     environment of that name.
    </para>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>Method 3</title>
    <para>
     The shifted function keys, <literal>&lt;S-F1&gt;</literal> to
     <literal>&lt;S-F4&gt;</literal>can also be optionally mapped
     to some common environments which you insert most often. The
     environments mapped to each key can also be customized. See
     the |texrc| file for details.
    </para>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>Method 4</title>
    <para>
     Environments can also be inserted by pressing a 3 capital
     letter sequence starting with an <literal>E</literal>. The following subsection
     describes this in detail. The sequence of 3 letters generally
     tries to follow the following rules:
    </para>
    <para>
     1. All environment mappings begin with <literal>E</literal>
    </para>
    <para>
     2. If the environment can be broken up into 2 distinct words,
     such as flushright (flush + right), then the next 2 letters
     are the first letters of the 2 words.  Example:
     <programlisting>flushleft  (_f_lush + _l_eft)  ---&gt; EFL
flushright (_f_lush + _r_ight) ---&gt; EFR
eqnarray   (_e_qn + _a_rray)   ---&gt; EEA</programlisting>
     If on the other hand, the environment name cannot be broken
     up into 2 distinct words, then the next 2 letters are the
     first 2 letters of the name of the environment.
     Example:
     <programlisting>equation (_eq_uation)          ---&gt; EEQ</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
     Unfortunately there are some environments that cannot be
     split in two words and first two letters in name are
     identical. In this case shortcut is created from E, first and
     last letter.  Example:
     <programlisting>quote     (_q_uot_e_)          ---&gt; EQE
quotation (_q_uotatio_n_)      ---&gt; EQN</programlisting>
     Of course, not every last one of the environments can follow
     this rule because of ambiguities. In case of doubt, pull down
     the Tex-Environments menu. The menu item should give the hint
     for the map.
    </para>
   </section>
  </section>
  <section id="visual-mode-environment-mapings">
   <title>Visual-mode Environment Mappings</title>
   <para>
    &ls; provides visual-mode mappings which enclose visually
    selected portions of text in environments. These mappings are
    derived from the corresponding insert-mode environment mappings
    according to the following simple rule:

    <programlisting>ECE           --&gt; ,ce</programlisting>
    The rule simply says that the leading <literal>E</literal> is
    converted to <literal>,</literal> and the next 2 letters are
    small case.  

    Here <literal>ECE</literal> is the insert-mode map which inserts
    the <literal>\begin{center} ... \end{center}</literal>
    environment.  Correspondingly, if you select a portion of text
    visually and press <literal>,ce</literal> while still in visual
    mode, then the selected portion will be enclosed in
    <literal>\begin{center} ... \end{center}</literal>.

    Some of the visual mode mappings are sensitive to whether you
    choose line-wise or character-wise. For example, if you choose a
    word and press <literal>,ce</literal>, then you get
    <literal>\centerline{word}</literal>, whereas if you press
    <literal>,ce</literal> on a line-wise selection, you get:
    <programlisting>\begin{center}
    line
\end{center}</programlisting>
   </para>
  </section>
  <section id="font-maps">
   <title>Font Mappings</title> 
   <para>
    These mappings insert font descriptions such as:
    <literal>\textsf{&ph;}&ph;</literal>
    with the cursor left in place of the first <link
     linkend="place-holders">placeholder</link> (the &ph; characters).
   </para>
   <para>
    Mnemonic:
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>first letter is always F (F for font)</listitem>
     <listitem>next 2 letters are the 2 letters describing the font.</listitem>
    </orderedlist>
   </para>
   <para>
    Example: Typing <literal>FEM</literal> in insert-mode expands to
    <literal>\textem{&ph;}&ph;</literal>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Just like environment mappings, you can visually select an area and press
    <literal>`sf</literal> to have it enclosed in:
    <literal>\textsf{word}</literal>
    or
    <programlisting>{\sffamily
line
}</programlisting>
    depending on character-wise or line-wise selection.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section id="section-mappings">
   <title>Section Mappings</title> 
   <para>
    These maps insert &latex; sections such as:
    <programlisting>\section{&ph;}&ph;</programlisting>
    etc. Just as in the case of environments and fonts, can be enclosed with a
    visual selection. The enclosing is not sensetive to character or line-wise
    selection.
   </para>
   <para>
    Mnemonic: (make your own!)
    <programlisting>SPA for part
SCH for chapter
SSE for section
SSS for subsection
SS2 for subsubsection
SPG for paragraph
SSP for subparagraph</programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>
    Example:
    SSE in insert mode inserts
    <programlisting>\section{&lt;++&gt;}&lt;++&gt;</programlisting>
    If you select a word or line and press <literal>,se</literal>, then you
    get
    <programlisting>\section{section name}</programlisting>
    The menu item in Tex-Environments.Sections have a sub-menu called
    'Advanced'. Choosing an item from this sub-menu asks a couple of questions
    (whether you want to include the section in the table of contents, whether
    there is a shorter name for the table of contents) and then creates a more
    intelligent template.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>Diacritics are disabled by default in &ls; because they can

   </para>
   <para>
    When latex-suite starts up, it scans the
    <literal>$VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/macros/</literal> directory and
    creates a menu from the files found there. Each file is considered as
    a single macro. You can place your own macros in this directory,

    When you choose a macro from the menu, the corresponding file is read
    into the current buffer after the current cursor position. In non-gui
    mode, you can use the |TMacro| command instead of choosing from the
    menu. This command takes the macro file name as an argument. When
    called without arguments (preferred usage), then a list of avaiable
    macro files is displayed and the user is prompted to choose one of

  <title>Compiling &latex; files via &ls;</title>
  <para>
   This functionality, available via the TeX-Suite menu, provides various tools
   to compile and debug &latex; files from within &vim;.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you are using commonly used LaTeX tools, then you should be all set as
   soon as you download and install latex-suite.  In order to compile a LaTeX
   file, simply press <literal>\ll</literal> while editing the file.  This
   runs latex on the current file and displays the errors in a
   |quickfix-window|. You can then scroll through the errors and press
   <literal>&lt;enter&gt;</literal> to be taken to the location of the
   corresponding error. Along with the errors being listed in the quickfix
   window, the corresponding log file is also opened in |preview| mode beneath
   the quickfix window. It is scrolled automatically to keep in sync with the
   error being viewed in the quickfix window.
  </para>
  <para>
   &ls; also supports compiling &latex; into formats other than DVI. By
   default, &ls; supports PDF and PS formats. In order to choose a format
   other than DVI, use the <literal>TTarget</literal> command or the
   <literal>TeX-Suite > Target Format</literal> menu item. This will ask you
   to type in the name of the target format you want to compile to. If a rule
   has been defined for the format (as described in the next
   <link linkend="compiler-rules">section</link>), then &ls; will switch to
   that format.
  </para>
   <para>Trying to choose a format for which no rule has been defined will
    result in &ls; displaying a warning message without taking any action.
   </para>
  <section id="compiler-rules">
   <title>Setting Compilation rules.</title>
   <para>
    In order to compile &latex; files into various formats, &ls; needs to know
    which external programs to call and in which way they need to be called.
    This information is provided to &ls; via a number of "rules". For each
    format you want to compile to, you need to specify a rule. A rule is
    specified by defining a variable of the form:
   </para>
   <programlisting>g:Tex_CompileRule_&lt;format&gt;</programlisting>
   <para>
    where <literal>&lt;format&gt;</literal> is a string like
    <literal>"pdf"</literal>, <literal>"dvi"</literal> etc.
   </para>
   <para>
    Example: By default, &ls; uses the following rule for compiling &latex;
    documents into DVI.
    <programlisting>g:Tex_CompileRule_dvi = 'latex --interaction=nonstopmode $*'</programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>
    Default values are also provided for ps and pdf formats. You might want to
    change these rules in texrc according to your local tex environment.
   </para>
   <note>
    <title>Handling Dependencies in compilation</title>
    <para>
     Specifying a different format does not automatically account for
     dependencies. For example, if in your case, you use
     <programlisting>.tex -&gt; .dvi -&gt; .ps -&gt; .pdf</programlisting>
     to generate PDF files from DVI, then you will need to choose dvi first,
     compile, change format to ps, compile, change format and so on. You could
     automate this via a mapping as follows:
     <programlisting>function! Tex_CompileToPDF()
    TCTarget dvi
    normal \ll
    TCTarget ps
    normal \ll
    TCTarget pdf
    normal \ll
endfunction
nmap \pdf :call Tex_CompileToPDF()&lt;CR&gt;</programlisting>

     For win32 users user MikTeX, sometimes the latex compiler's output has a
     bug where a single number is split across different lines. In this case,

  <section id="latex-master-file">
   <title>Specifying which file to compile</title>
   <para>
    Often times the file you are currently editing is only a fragment being
    <literal>\input</literal>'ed into a master tex file. In such cases you
    will need to do create a dummy file in the directory containing the
    current file. This dummy file is of the form:
    <literal>&lt;mainfilename&gt;.latexmain</literal>
   </para>
   <para>
    As an example, suppose you have the following setup:
    <programlisting>% file: main.tex
\documentclass{report}
\begin{document}

\input{chapter1.tex}

\end{document}</programlisting>
    In other words, even when you are editing <literal>chapter1.tex</literal>,
    you want to compile <literal>main.tex</literal>. In this situation, create
    a file called <literal>main.tex.latexmain</literal> in the directory
    containing <literal>chapter1.tex</literal> (and
    <literal>main.tex</literal>). After doing this, when you press
    <literal>\ll</literal> while editing <literal>chapter1.tex</literal>, then
    &ls; will compile <literal>main.tex</literal> instead.
   </para>
   <note>
    <para>
     Here <literal>main.tex.latexmain</literal> is (obviously) a different
     file from <literal>main.tex</literal> itself. <literal>main.tex</literal>
     need not be renamed. The contents of
     <literal>main.tex.latexmain</literal> are not used.  This ofcourse
     restricts each directory to have a single master file.

  <section id="compiler-output-customization">
   <title>Customizing the compiler output</title>
   <para>
    Latex-suite ships with a enhanced version of the standard tex compiler
    plugin maintained by Artem Chuprina. The modifications allow this version
    to be customizable. i.e the user can set a verbosity level for the
    compiler.
   </para>
   <para>
    By default it is set up in a "non-verbose", "ignore-common-warnings" mode,
    which means that irrelevant lines from the compilers output will be
    ignored and also some very common warnings are ignored.
   </para>
   <para>
    Depending on the "ignore-level", (which can be set with the command TCLevel as
    described below) the following kinds of messages are ignored.  An ignore level
    of 3 for instance means that messages of type 1-3 will be ignored. By default,
    the ignore level is set to 4. (You can change this by setting
    g:Tex_IgnoreLevel in your .vimrc).
   </para>
   <orderedlist numeration="arabic">
    <listitem><literal>LaTeX Warning: Underfull box ...</literal></listitem>
    <listitem><literal>LaTeX Warning: Overfull box ... </literal>
     both these warnings (very common) are due to \hbox settings not being
     satisfied nicely.</listitem>
    <listitem><literal>LaTeX Warning: Specifier 'h' changed to 't'.</literal>
     This errors occurs when TeX is not able to correctly place a floating
     object at a specified location, because of which it defaulted to the
     top of the page.</listitem>
    <listitem><literal>LaTeX Warning: You have requested ...,</literal>
     This warning occurs in slitex when using the xypic package.</listitem>
    <listitem><literal>Missing number error:</literal>
     Usually, when the name of an included eps file is spelled incorrectly,
     then the \bb-error message is accompanied by a bunch of "missing
     number, treated as zero" error messages. This level ignores these
     warnings.
    </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
   <note>
    <para>
     number 5 is actually a LaTeX error, not a warning!
    </para>
   </note>
   <para>
    Use
   </para>
   <programlisting>TCLevel &lt;level&gt;</programlisting>
   <para>
    where level is a number to set the ignore level dynamically. This will re-do
    the <literal>'errorformat'</literal> setting in &vim; so that the next
    time you compile the document, you will not be shown the first
    <literal>&lt;level&gt;</literal> kinds of warnings/errors. Use "TCLevel 0"
    to ignore no warnings at all, but still remain in a "non-verbose", i.e
    ignore unmatched lines mode.
   </para>
   <para>
    When TCLevel is called with the unquoted string strict as follows:
   </para>
   <programlisting>TClevel strict</programlisting>
   <para>
    then the 'efm' switches to a "verbose", "no-lines-ignored" mode which is
    useful when you want to make final checks of your document and want to be
    careful not to let things slip by.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can also choose to ignore other kinds of patterns by setting
    g:IgnoreWarnings in your ~/.vimrc. This is a '¡' seperated list of commands.
    Its default value is:
   </para>
   <programlisting>let g:Tex_IgnoredWarnings =
    \'Underfull¡'.
    \'Overfull¡'.
    \'specifier changed to¡'.
    \'You have requested¡'.
