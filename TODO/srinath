latex-suite Bugs

9 mapping for <F5> is not buffer local. Moreover, it only affects first
  edited file.
8 smartspace has a bug where if a <space> is entered at
  $aaaaaaaaaa..................<space>$, then newlines are entered after
  the current line.

latex-suite Changes

8 collect all mappings from latex-suite into one central location.
  Benji suggests texrc. Other option is a file latex-suite/texmaps.vim
  which is sourced everytime. texrc might be more intuitive from a
  customization standpoint, however, some mappings need to be buffer local
  therefore need to set every time a .tex file is BufEnter'ed. texrc is
  sourced only once...
